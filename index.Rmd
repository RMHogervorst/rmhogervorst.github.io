<div class="p-note">
I really like R, programming and data engineering. 


But R is not the only language in the world. I work with Python and SQL too.
I try to update this page, but if you want to see what I'm currently working on, you should check out my github profile (I develop almost everything in  the open) on <https:://github.com/rmhogervorst> .

I often find myself building tools for personal use that are useful for others as well.
My current interests are: R, open source, open science and reproducible research. I dabble in text analyses, prediction and automation.


You can find my <a href="https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl" rel="me" class="u-url">blogposts here</a>. R-specific posts (most of my blogposts) are also syndicated to [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/roel-m-hogervorst/ "my posts on r-bloggers") and I syndicate posts to <a href="https://dev.to/rmhogervorst" rel="me" class="u-url">dev.to</a> too.
When I have half-finished work, that nevertheless needs a place to live, I post it to my secondary blog <a href="https://notes.rmhogervorst.nl/" rel="me" class="u-url"> notes.rmhogervorst.nl </a>

You can find me on many social media platforms:

* I'm on twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/RoelMHogervorst" rel="me">@RoelMHogervorst</a>. 
* I'm on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmhogervorst" rel="me">linkedIn</a> too
* I started a  <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.technology/@rmhogervorst">Mastodon</a> account too.
* My keybase is here <https://keybase.io/rmhogervorst/ > though I think most people left keybase

You can find a lot of my work on
* <a href="https://github.com/RMHogervorst" rel="me">github</a>
* <a href="https://gitlab.com/rmhogervorst" rel="me">gitlab</a>
* <a href="https://bitbucket.org/RMHogervorst/" rel="me">bitbucket</a> (not a lot there)
