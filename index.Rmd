Hi! I'm Roel, 
I really like R, programming and open science. I'm involved in software/data carpentry and teaching people the basics of R. 

I often find myself building tools for personal use that are useful for others as well. For example I'm working on a [tool that documents your dataset](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/summarize_dat "github, summarize dat") and useful [templates](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/templates)for scripts
and folders. 

I've also created [an R package to access IMDB information](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/imdb "IMDB, available on github") about series, and a package to create [badges](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/badgecreatr "developmental version") for github  [stable version on CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=badgecreatr "CRAN page, `install.packages("badgecreatr")`") .
I have also created datasets about [werewolves](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/werewolf "werewolf dataset on github: with actual human characteristics") and every line spoken and described in the tvseries [Star Trek The Next Generation](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/TNG). 


My current interests are: R, open source, open science and reproducible research. I dabble in text analyses, prediction and automation. Currently predicting and explaining student succes at Leiden University.
