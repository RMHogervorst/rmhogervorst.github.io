Hi! I'm Roel, 
I'm a data scientist and I really like R, programming and open science. I'm involved in software/data carpentry and teaching people the basics of R. 


But R is not the only language in the world. I work with Python and SQL too. 
I try to update this page, but if you want to see what I'm currently working on, you should check out my github profile (I develop almost everything in  the open) on <https:://github.com/rmhogervorst> .

I often find myself building tools for personal use that are useful for others as well. 
My current interests are: R, open source, open science and reproducible research. I dabble in text analyses, prediction and automation.
