[about me](index.html) |[Professional](professional.html) | Interests   | 


Hi! I'm Roel, 
I really like r, programming and many other nerd-like things. I really like to
create things such as datasets, programs and handy tools. 
I often find myself building tools for personal use that are usefull for others as well.




In recent years I have produced some r-packages (for example [badgecreatr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/badgecreatr/index.html))

You can find my [blogposts](http://rmhogervorst.nl/cleancode/) on [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/author/roel-m-hogervorst/)




Interests

Iâ€™m fond of Data Science and a R enthusiast.
