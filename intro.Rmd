Hi! I'm Roel, 
I really like r, programming and many other nerd-like things. I really like to
create things such as datasets, programs and handy tools. 
I often find myself building tools for personal use that are usefull for others as well.

Interested in R, open source, open science and reproducible research. Currently predicting and explaining student succes in Leiden University.


In recent years I have produced some r-packages (for example [badgecreatr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/badgecreatr/index.html))
